# Android Technical Test

## **Prerequisites**

1. A fully functional and up to date Android / Kotlin development environnement 
2. A valid GitHub account 
3. Access to the repository tagged with your name on our GitHub [https://github.com/alexandregaba-macare](https://github.com/alexandregaba-macare?tab=repositories)

## Objectives :

MirambeauAppCare creates softwares to help patients manage their diabetes. This exercice needs you to develop a small ***Kotlin application*** to monitor the blood glucose of its users.

Main features :
- the patient should be able to input his glycemia level (float) at a specified date+hour
- the patient should also be able to see his inputs in a list view ordered by date/hour

## **Todo :**

1. Create the application
3. Implement the actions needed to handle user interactions
4. Maybe add some functional logic to handle input errors
5. The user inputs are short lived, how could we make them a bit more persistent? (client only solution)

## **Going further :**

- Maybe add some "must have" features like filters to quickly find items
- Bootstrapped applications tend to lack in sexyness, what can we do to change that ?
- Feel free to add some tests, or even code in TDD
- Any other improvement, suggestion? Go on and show us :)
